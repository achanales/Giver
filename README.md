Giver is a chrome extension that interfaces with news websites to suggest charities related to the content of the news article you are reading. This repo contains the code used to model the similarity between articles and charity mission statements. Code for the front-end chrome extension can be found in a seperate repository https://github.com/achanales/Giver_chrome_extension/
